Hello, my name is Sā́mapriya Vásu [s̻ɑ̈́mɐprɪjɐ ʋɐ́s̻ʊ] (officially spelled ⟨Samopriya Basu⟩). I am a post-doctoral researcher at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/stat-actsci.html) in the [Vancouver Metro area](https://metrovancouver.org/), Canada, under the supervision of [Prof. Donald Estep](https://canssi.ca/don-estep/) [ˈd̥anɫ̩d ˈijstɛʔ͡p], where I work on the foundations of Statistics, inverse problems, and applications to linguistic and geophysical problems. Before starting this post-doc, I completed my PhD in Statistics in 2021 at the [University of North Carolina](https://stor.unc.edu/) at [Chapel Hill](https://www.townofchapelhill.org/), USA, advised by [Prof. Jan Hannig](https://hannig.cloudapps.unc.edu/) [jän hänːɪɡ]. I was born and grew up in the city of [Calcutta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata) (officially spelled ⟨Kolkata⟩ these days) in eastern India, where I also got my pre-doctoral Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees in Statistics, both from the [University of Calcutta](https://www.caluniv.ac.in/academic/Statistics.html).

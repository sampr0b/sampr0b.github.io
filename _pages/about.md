Hello, my name is Samopriya Basu সামপ্রিয় বসু. I am a post-doctoral researcher at [Simon Fraser University (SFU)](https://www.sfu.ca/stat-actsci.html) in the [Vancouver Metro area](https://metrovancouver.org/), Canada, under the supervision of [Prof. Donald Estep](https://canssi.ca/don-estep/), where I work on the foundations of Statistics, inverse problems, and applications to linguistic and geophysical problems. Before starting this post-doc, I completed my PhD in Statistics in 2021 at the [University of North Carolina](https://stor.unc.edu/) at [Chapel Hill](https://www.townofchapelhill.org/), USA, advised by [Prof. Jan Hannig](https://hannig.cloudapps.unc.edu/). I was born and grew up in the city of [Calcutta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata) (officially spelled ⟨Kolkata⟩ these days) in eastern India, where I also got my pre-doctoral Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees in Statistics, both from the [University of Calcutta](https://www.caluniv.ac.in/academic/Statistics.html).

Since starting in my current position at SFU at the end of April 2022, I have worked in close collaboration with fellow post-doctoral statistician [Dr. Faezeh Yazdi فایزه یزدی](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Faezeh-Yazdi) and our industry partners at [IDEON Technologies](https://ideon.ai/) led by physicist [Dr. Doug Schouten](https://ideon.ai/team/doug-schouten/) on inverse problems arising out of muon tomography for mining applications and uncertainty quantification for them within a Bayesian framework. In addition, Faezeh and I have started working on the theory behind Bayesian inversion, and foundational work on the general relation between inverse problems and Bayesian statistics. For my PhD, under the advisement of Prof. Jan Hannig, I worked on the inverse problem of parameter estimation for a certain class of stochastic differential equations in a fiducial framework. In general, my mathematical interests range from theoretical exploration of statistical paradigms and inverse problems to stochastic processes and Malliavin calculus.

I am also involved in a few computational linguistics projects. My main languages of interest are Indo-Iranic and Caucasian languages, but since moving to the Vancouver area have also begun learning about the indigenous languages of the North American Pacific Northwest. Previously, I had collaborated with [Aryaman Arora ਆਰ੍ਯਮਣ ਅਰੋੜਾ](https://aryaman.io/) et al. on an open access online comparative lexicon of the languages of the Indian Subcontinent, [<i>Jambu</i>](https://neojambu.herokuapp.com/). We are still refining that work (this sort of stuff never truly gets done!). Building on that experience, I am collaborating on the international [<i>Atlas of the Languages of Iran</i>](http://www.iranatlas.net/index.html) project spearheaded by [Prof. Erik Anonby](https://carleton.ca/french/people/erik-anonby-2/) at Carleton University, and together with [Prof. Donna Gerdts](http://www.sfu.ca/~gerdts/) at SFU, I have begun work for an online comparative dictionary of Salishan languages.

For more details on any of these projects, or to know what else I am currently involved in, check out my [<tt>research</tt>](https://sampr0b.github.io/projects/) and [<tt>publications</tt>](https://sampr0b.github.io/publications/) pages.

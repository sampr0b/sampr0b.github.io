Hello, my name is Samopriya Basu ‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶Æ‡¶™‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶ø‡ßü ‡¶¨‡¶∏‡ßÅ. I am a post-doctoral researcher at [Simon Fraser University (SFU)](https://www.sfu.ca/stat-actsci.html) in the [Vancouver Metro area](https://metrovancouver.org/), Canada, under the supervision of [Prof. Donald Estep](https://canssi.ca/don-estep/), where I work on the foundations of Statistics, inverse problems, and applications to linguistic and geophysical problems. Before starting this post-doc, I completed my PhD in Statistics in 2021 at the [University of North Carolina](https://stor.unc.edu/) at [Chapel Hill](https://www.townofchapelhill.org/) (UNC‚ÄìCH), USA, advised by [Prof. Jan Hannig](https://hannig.cloudapps.unc.edu/). I was born and grew up in the city of [Calcutta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata) (officially spelled ‚ü®Kolkata‚ü© these days) in eastern India, where I also got my pre-doctoral Master‚Äôs and Bachelor‚Äôs degrees in Statistics, both from the [University of Calcutta](https://www.caluniv.ac.in/academic/Statistics.html).

Since starting in my current position at SFU at the end of April 2022, I have worked in close collaboration with fellow post-doctoral statistician [Dr. Faezeh Yazdi ŸÅÿß€åÿ≤Ÿá €åÿ≤ÿØ€å](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Faezeh-Yazdi) and our industry partners at [IDEON Technologies](https://ideon.ai/) led by [Dr. Doug Schouten](https://ideon.ai/team/doug-schouten/) on inverse problems arising out of muon tomography for mining applications, and uncertainty quantification for them within a Bayesian framework. In addition, together with Prof. Don Estep and Faezeh, I am working on the theory behind Bayesian inversion, as well as exploring the general relationship between (stochastic) inverse problems and Bayesian Statistics. For my PhD at UNC‚ÄìCH, I worked on the inverse problem of parameter estimation for a certain class of stochastic differential equations in a fiducial framework. In general, my mathematical interests range broadly from theoretical exploration of statistical paradigms and inverse problems to stochastic processes and Malliavin calculus.

Fun fact! My brother, [Debopriya Basu ‡¶¶‡ßá‡¶¨‡¶™‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶ø‡ßü ‡¶¨‡¶∏‡ßÅ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deb0priya-basu/?trk=public_profile_browsemap&originalSubdomain=ca), is also a statistician and is working toward his PhD on independent component analysis at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/math-stats.html) in [Montr√©al](https://montreal.ca/).

I am also involved in a few computational linguistics projects. My main languages of interest are Indo-Iranic and Caucasian languages, but since moving to the Vancouver area I have also begun looking into the indigenous languages of the North American Pacific Northwest. Previously, I had collaborated with [Aryaman Arora ‡®Ü‡®∞‡©ç‡®Ø‡®Æ‡®£ ‡®Ö‡®∞‡©ã‡©ú‡®æ](https://aryaman.io/) et al. on an open access online comparative dictionary of the languages of the Indian Subcontinent, [<i>Jambu</i>](https://neojambu.herokuapp.com/). We are still refining that work (this sort of stuff never truly gets done!). Building on that experience, I am collaborating on the international [<i>Atlas of the Languages of Iran</i>](http://www.iranatlas.net/index.html) project spearheaded by [Prof. Erik Anonby](https://carleton.ca/french/people/erik-anonby-2/) at Carleton University, and I have also begun work developing an online comparative lexicon of Salishan languages with [Prof. Donna Gerdts](http://www.sfu.ca/~gerdts/) at SFU. Finally, my friend [Dr. Carmen Amo Alonso](https://camoalon.github.io/) (post-doc, ETH‚ÄìZ√ºrich) and I are attempting to mathematically model human speech sounds. This last project is still in its infancy, but expect cool stuff coming out of it soon! 

For more information on any of these projects, or to know what else I am currently working on, check out my [<tt>research</tt>](https://sampr0b.github.io/projects/) and [<tt>publications</tt>](https://sampr0b.github.io/publications/) pages. Details of my experience with teaching can be found in the [<tt>teaching</tt>](https://sampr0b.github.io/teaching/) page.

Besides research, I enjoy language-learning and try to spread awareness about the dire threat facing linguistic diversity in today‚Äôs world. To this end, I run a [<tt>Twitter</tt>  (or ùïè if you will)](https://twitter.com/avzaagzonunaada) account where I post short threads on some minority languages I have studied or otherwise know about. I have also appeared on my friend Edinburgh-linguist [Danny Bate](https://dannybate.com/about/)‚Äôs podcast [<i>A Language I Love Is...</i>](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5HgfQXYDc2epQtrnt5AEjs?si=7gJDMk7VQHOv5Im0mTcreQ) to talk about Ossetian ‚Äî a language native to the Caucasus I dearly love ‚Äî and on Georgina Rose‚Äôs podcast [<i>the postmodern iconoclast</i>](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6iY0uWSQThNAHc4a0Ravbx?si=fKQf5THXTGqA8QGyV8_m0g) to discuss ‚Äúancient‚Äù languages and how and what linguists and epigraphists can know about them. Non-language hobbies of mine include horse- and camel-riding (not many camels around though) and bouldering.

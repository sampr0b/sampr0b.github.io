Hello, my name is Sā́mapriya Vásu সামপ্রিয় বসু (officially spelled ⟨Samopriya Basu⟩). I am a post-doctoral researcher at [Simon Fraser University (SFU)](https://www.sfu.ca/stat-actsci.html) in the [Vancouver Metro area](https://metrovancouver.org/), Canada, under the supervision of [Prof. Donald Estep](https://canssi.ca/don-estep/), where I work on the foundations of Statistics, inverse problems, and applications to linguistic and geophysical problems. Before starting this post-doc, I completed my PhD in Statistics in 2021 at the [University of North Carolina](https://stor.unc.edu/) at [Chapel Hill](https://www.townofchapelhill.org/), USA, advised by [Prof. Jan Hannig](https://hannig.cloudapps.unc.edu/). I was born and grew up in the city of [Calcutta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata) (officially spelled ⟨Kolkata⟩ these days) in eastern India, where I also got my pre-doctoral Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees in Statistics, both from the [University of Calcutta](https://www.caluniv.ac.in/academic/Statistics.html).

Since starting in my current position at SFU at the end of April 2022, I have worked in close collaboration with fellow post-doctoral statistician [Dr. Faezeh Yazdi](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Faezeh-Yazdi) فایزه یزدی and our industry partners at [IDEON Technologies](https://ideon.ai/) led by physicist [Dr. Doug Schouten](https://ideon.ai/team/doug-schouten/) on inverse problems arising out of muon tomography for mining applications and uncertainty quantification for them within a Bayesian framework. In addition, Faezeh and I have started working on the theory behind Bayesian inversion, and foundational work on the general relation between inverse problems and Bayesian statistics.

I am also involved in a few computational linguistics projects. Previously, I had collaborated with [Aryaman Arora](https://aryaman.io/) ਆਰ੍ਯਮਣ ਅਰੋੜਾ et al. on an open access online comparative lexicon of the languages of the Indian Subcontinent, [<i>Jambu</i>](https://neojambu.herokuapp.com/). We are still refining that work (this sort of stuff never truly gets done!). Building on that experience, I am collaborating on the [<i>Atlas of the Languages of Iran</i>](http://www.iranatlas.net/index.html) project led by Iranist [Prof. Erik Anonby](https://carleton.ca/french/people/erik-anonby-2/) at Carleton University. Together with Salishanist [Prof. Donna Gerdts](http://www.sfu.ca/~gerdts/) at SFU, I have also begun the development of a comparative dictionary of Salishan languages.

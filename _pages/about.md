Hello, my name is Sā̓mapriya Vasu (officially spelled <i>Samopriya Basu</i>). I am a post-doctoral researcher at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/stat-actsci.html) in the [Vancouver Metro area](https://metrovancouver.org/), Canada, under the supervision of [Prof. Donald Estep](https://canssi.ca/don-estep/), where I work on the foundations of Statistics and applications to linguistic and geophysical problems. Before starting this post-doc, I completed my PhD in Statistics in 2021 at the [University of North Carolina](https://stor.unc.edu/) at [Chapel Hill](https://www.townofchapelhill.org/), USA, advised by [Prof. Jan Hannig](https://hannig.cloudapps.unc.edu/). I was born and grew up in the city of [Calcutta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata) (officially spelled <i>Kolkata</i> these days) in eastern India, where I also got my pre-doctoral Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees in Statistics, both from the [University of Calcutta](https://www.caluniv.ac.in/academic/Statistics.html).



You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
